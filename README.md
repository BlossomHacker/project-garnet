# project-garnet
This is my senior project for the Fall 2020 semester at the University of North Carolina at Asheville.

Included below are the extended credits for resources I used to help develop the algorithms in Project Garnet.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnqN0v95jtU&list=PLcRSafycjWFfEPbSSjGMNY-goOZTuBPMW - Binary Space Partitioning, Used some theory from here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7yyZZjF1z4&list=PLFt_AvWsXl0eZgMK_DT5_biRkWXftAOf9 - Cellular cave, this tutorial series helped me improve my code a huge amount, getting the cellular system working without too much bloat was hard but this guy managed to do it in less than 2000 lines.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feNVBEPXAcE - For the L-systems, this helped with getting the trees looking good and also helped in making a demo scene that i created to show off the trees in action.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1B4UoSQMFw - This also helped with the L-systems, this guy explains the theory pretty well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo3VGyF5z8Q - This tutorial helped me get some of my code working optimally, before this one my trees were seriously slow and took up a lot of computational energy
https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/input-management/first-person-all-in-one-135316 - I made myself a first person controller, but i ended up scrapping it and using this controller instead, it's a farely standard controller, but it works awesome
https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/version-control/github-for-unity-118069 - I used unity github version control. I wasn't likely to do too well making that myself
https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/textures-materials/free-stylized-pbr-textures-pack-111778 - public domain textures to spruce things up a little
https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/textures-materials/sky/fantasy-skybox-free-18353 - Some free skyboxes, I didn't use them, but I figured i'd drop a credit down here anyway.
